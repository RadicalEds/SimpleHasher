# SimpleHasher
CLI Tool to Calculate Perceptual Hashes For Media Files

### Requirements
- Python3 Pillow
- Python3 numpy

### About
This tool generates perceptual hashes for media files    

Currently, only Images, using the aHash greyscale algorithm (Average Hash Algorithm)    

### Future Features
Implement the pHash and dHash algorithms, as well as some custom algorithms, and allow the user choose between them.    
The Ability to Calculate Hamming Distance between Two Hashes to report a percentage of similarity between two hashes.    
Output Formats Such as JSON, CSV, or even XML
