# SimpleHasher
CLI Tool to Calculate Perceptual Hashes For Media Files

### Requirements
Python3 Pillow
Python3 numpy

### About
This tool generates perceptual hashes for media files   

Currently, Only Images, using a greyscale aHash algorithm (Average Hash Algorithm)   

### Roadmap
In Future Versions we will implement the popular pHash and dHash algorithms, as well as some custom algorithms, and allow the user choose between them   
The Ability to Calculate Hamming Distance between Two Hashes to report a percentage of similarity between two hashes.
